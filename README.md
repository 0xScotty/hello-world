# hello-world

Hi there!

I like coding, that is what I think so far. I am really new to this, started in Codecademy a few months ago (actually at the beginning of the quarantine here in Colombia) but for work and time reasons, I had to put my programming learning on stand-by, until now... 

Now I'm very happy to be back, learning a super-power and being a full-time entrepreneur.
